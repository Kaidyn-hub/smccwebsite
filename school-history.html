            <h2>SCHOOL'S HISTORY</h2>
            <p>In 1948, NASIPIT was still a part of the Parish of Buenavista, whose Parish Priest was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry of the Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr. Martin and his co-adjurer Fr. Atanacio de Castro saw the need of putting-up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was made in charge of the school.</p>
            <p>It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the first Director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr. Vicente Portillo, Rev. Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, and Rev. Fr. Anthony Krol in the order of succession. Rev. Fr. Krol was the last Dutch priest who served as the school director.</p>
            <p>The school site is beside the rectory with an area of 1,630 sq.m. Fr. Gerard Cruisjen, one of the subsequent Directors converted the nipa-wooden structure into a concrete two-storey building with 16 classrooms.</p>
